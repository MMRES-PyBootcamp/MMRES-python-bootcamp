We usually load NumPy with the `np` alias:"

Lists can be \"heterogeneous\", meaning that they can store elements of a variety of types, and they are quite fast when used to perform individual operations on a handful of elements. However, depending on the characteristics of the data and the types of operations that need to be performed, other containers like NumPy `ndarray` may be more appropriate.\n",
